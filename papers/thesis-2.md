Malaria infections caused by Plasmodium spp. parasites are a serious public health problem that disproportionately affects the poorest and youngest people in the world. With 216 million infections occurring annually and growing resistance to all front-line drugs, we are in desperate need of new antimalarials with novel mechanisms-of-action. Plasmodium and other Apicomplexan parasites contain an essential, non-photosynthetic plastid organelle, called the apicoplast, which is a key antimalarial target. Apicoplast biogenesis pathways present untapped opportunities to discover new parasite-specific drug targets. This thesis describes the discovery of a first-in-class apicoplast biogenesis inhibitor as well as a characterization of the surprising downstream cellular effects of the three major classes of apicoplast inhibitors in Apicomplexan parasites.
