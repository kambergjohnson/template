During the 2011-2012 school year, I wrote my honors undergraduate thesis in Professor Dave Wemmer's Laboratory at University of California, Berkeley. I performed a molecular tweezers experiment on the transcription initiation protein, σ54, to determine the number of unfolding events in an attempt to better understand the mechanism behind σ54 transcription initiation.

In bacteria, σ factors regulate cellular transcription. They must associate with RNA Polymerase (RNAP) to form the σ-RNAP holoenzyme that then can melt double-stranded DNA and initiate transcription. Most σ factors are part of the σ70 class that can immediately initiate transcription after association with RNA Polymerase. σ54, however, requires activation by an AAA+ ATPase activator protein that remodels the σ54-RNAP complex into an open, active conformation [1].

Activation of σ54 may work through a simple bind-and-release by the AAA+ ATPase activator. Alternatively, the ATPase may perform multiple rounds to ATP hydrolysis to exert a "tugging" force on σ54. The latter hypothesis is supported by evidence of a fracture point between the two subdomains of the core binding domain of σ54 [2]. My project aimed to mimic the proposed tugging by the ATPase activator to observe the number of protein unfolding events of the core binding domain. 

We found that approximately 20% of the core-binding domain of σ54 unfolds before the rest of the domain during force-extension cycles with the molecular tweezers. This uncooperative unfolding is highly unsual for single proteins domains and supports the hypothesis that the activator may pull on σ54 to generate a partially unfolded intermediate that allows for transcription.
