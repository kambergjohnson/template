summary: To identify the molecular target of actinonin, we selected resistant mutants in Toxoplasma gondii that could survive high amounts of drug.
---

To identify the target of actinonin, we initially  attempted to isolate actinonin-resistant P. falciparum but failed using multiple selection methods, including chemical mutagenesis, that successfully selected resistance against other compounds. Therefore, we turned to Toxoplasma gondii, a related apicomplexan parasite, which contains an apicoplast of the same evolutionary origin, because it is easier to grow to large numbers and to genetically modify. 

Because actinonin disrupted apicoplast biogenesis in both T. gondii and P. falciparum, suggesting a common target, we selected actinonin-resistant T.gondii and submitted resistant strains for whole-genome sequencing. Five out of eight independently selected clones contained a single point mutation in FtsH1, an apicoplast membrane metalloprotease. To validate FtsH1 as the genetic mechanism of resistance, we replaced the endogenous FtsH1 locus with either a wild-type or mutant FtsH1 locus. The mutated FtsH1 strain resulted in resistance, strongly suggesting FtsH1 as the target of actinonin. 

Lastly, we validated FtsH1 as the target of actinonin in P. falciparum. Using a FstH1 knock-down line, we  down-regulated FtsH1 expression and observed a 58-fold decrease in the actinonin EC50 upon knockdown of FtsH1 expression. To confirm that actinonin bound directly to FtsH1, we expressed and purified FtsH1 in vitro and found that actinonin inhibited protease activity of purified FtsH1. 

### A mutation in the protease domain of ftsH1 is sufficient to confer resistance to actinonin in <em>T. gondii</em>

The apicoplast is visualized using the T. gondii reporter strain RH FNR-RFP in which RFP is targeted to the apicoplast and the nucleus is stained with Hoescht 33342. Each parasite contains one apicoplast, except during cell division when there may be two. White arrows point at examples of T. gondii parasites missing an apicoplast.

### Knockdown of ftsH1 in <em>P. falciparum</em> leads to apicoplast loss and hypersensitivity to actinonin

  Schematic of the endogenous knockdown strategy. When aTC is present in the media, the tet-repressor binds aTC and does not bind the 10x-aptamer sequence, which relieves translational repression, allowing PfFtsH1 to be expressed. When aTC is washed out of the media, the tet-repressor binds the 10x-aptamer and prevents expression of PfFtsH1.
